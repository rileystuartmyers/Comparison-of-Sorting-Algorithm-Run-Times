# Comparison-of-Sorting-Algorithm-Run-Times
Uses the chrono C++ header in order to measure the running times of both Merge sort and Quick sort, each being tested on multiple test sizes and scenarios.

Both sorting algorithms are created through functions found in the header file 'sorting.h.' Along with these functions, the header file also contains multiple functions that can reverse or randomize the set for future sortings, along with an 'odd-even' function that exclusively adds odd and even numbers into the list. 

Thank you for reading, and I hope the results can interest you!
